        The aim of the National Service Scheme is education through community
        service. It offers the youth a wonderful opportunity to help the poor
        and the downtrooden. It creates a strong social awareness among the
        students and imparts personality development to its members through
        study and work, camps, social service activities and other useful and
        productive work. The volunteers enrolled info N.S.S after the screening
        process have to undergo a minimum of 240 hours work in two consecutive
        academic years. This college has one NSS unit. For this compulsory
        special camping programme for 7 days during Xâ€™mas holidays will be
        there. Besides this activities like cleaning the college campus and its
        surroundings, gardening etc, are taken up by the NSS volunteers
